      <p>Our clients take pride in bringing great products and services to
      market, and they count on us to meet their software development needs. If
      you would rather focus your efforts on your business than struggle with
      the technology to support it, then you’ve come to the right place.</p>

      <p>Madriska provides the same resources you would expect from an internal
      software development team: project management, analysis, design,
      development, testing, and operations. The main difference is that the
      support we provide is very flexible, and will always be based on what you
      need right now, not six months from now or six months ago. We also have
      experience in many different industries, and the knowledge we’ve gained
      over time will help us give you a head start on any project we work on
      together.</p>

      <p>We can help you with all sorts of different challenges, ranging from
      providing a bit of guidance on a special project to taking an entire
      product from the idea phase to launch and beyond. Our team has seen it
      all, and knows how to provide support for even the most complicated
      business problems.</p>

      <p>If you have a proposal for a project that you think Madriska might be a
      good fit for, please get in touch. We’re based in Chicago, but we have
      nearly a decade of experience in working remotely with clients around the
      world. So whether you’re in Wicker Park or Copenhagen, we’d love to hear
      from you.</p>

      <p>PS: Your phone call or email will go directly to me, not to a salesperson. That’s how we do things at Madriska, and we’re proud of it.
